# Rented-Bike-Sharing
The system will collect historical data on factors such as weather conditions, time of day, day of the week, and previous rental patterns. By analyzing this data, the XGBoost model will be trained to learn the complex relationships between these variables and the demand for rented bikes. Once trained, the model will be integrated into the rented bike sharing platform, enabling accurate predictions of future bike rental requirements.
By implementing this machine learning prediction system, bike sharing service providers can optimize their resources and ensure that an adequate number of bikes are available at any given time. This will enhance the user experience by minimizing instances of bike unavailability or excessive waiting times. The project's code and documentation will be made available on GitHub, allowing others to understand and replicate the implementation for their own rented bike sharing systems.
